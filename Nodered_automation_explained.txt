Node red automation explained

With a helper from home assistant I start or stop the automation.
When the automation is on, it starts every day at 9.00 a.m.

Between 9.00 a.m. and 1.15 p.m., it checks the output of the solar panels.
If more than 600 w are returned to the grid, it starts the dishwasher and then the dishwasher programme.
After the trigger command, the automation is blocked for 5 hours to prevent the dishwasher from starting again before 13:15.
To override the trigger block command the helper can be switched once.
When the program is finished he gives a text to speech command to google cast.
If at 13.00 there is still not enough power generated then the automation starts .
After 13.15 the automation stops.
