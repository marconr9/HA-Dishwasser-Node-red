# HA-Dishwasser-Node-red
In Home assistant use a automation with Node red to start the Dishwasser



In Home Assistant, I use an automation in Node red to control my dishwasher.
The idea is that as long as enough power is generated by the solar panels, the dishwasher will start automatically.
In addition, if there is not enough power from the solar panels, the dishwasher will still start after a certain amount of time.
Because in our house the dishwasher runs every day.
If, for example, there is a holiday or a few days away, the automation should not turn on.

What did I use for this?

Node red,
,Home assistant
,Dishwasser (with home connect)
